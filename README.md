# Bank Sentinel — PoC
AI-Driven Backend Security Automation for Banks & Enterprises  
Pilot Target: 50 Endpoints • Zero Human Fatigue • 24/7 Threat Defence

---

## 🚀 Project Mission
A system that acts like **5 full-time security engineers** working together:
- Detect attacks in seconds (Zero-Click, Phishing, Insider Threats)
- Automate response (block IP, isolate user, alert admin)
- Continuous learning from patterns
- Works silently in background without affecting customers

---

## 🧩 System Blueprint (v0.1 : Proof-of-Concept)
✅ Phase 1: Collect + Detect  
✅ Wazuh + Zeek integration  
✅ Log pipeline for real-time alerts  
🔄 Phase 2: AI auto-triage (LLM small models)  
🔄 Phase 3: Bank automation workflows  
🔒 Phase 4: Compliance + Secure audit trails

## 🔍 AI Agent Roles (Micro LLM Strategy)
| Agent | Role |
|------|------|
| Collector AI | Bank server se logs & anomalies capture |
| Analyst AI | Alert ka risk score predict |
| Pattern AI | New attack pattern learn |
| Responder AI | Auto actions suggest (admin approval) |
| Forensic AI | Evidence secure rakhe |

Human ke paas final approval.  
Industry-standard: Human In The Loop Security Automation.
